# PerceptronPlayground

Welcome to the Perceptron Playground! This playground demonstrates how to build and train a perceptron from scratch in Pure Swift.

## What you'll learn
- How perceptrons make predictions using weights and bias
- The step-by-step training process with real-time feedback
- How to train perceptrons on logical gate datasets (AND, OR, XOR)

## Playground Pages

//: [🔍 Inference](Inference)
Learn how a perceptron makes predictions on new inputs:
- Basic perceptron prediction structure
- Step-by-step calculation breakdown (dot product, weighted sum, activation)
- Example inference with different input combinations

//: [🎯 Training](Training)
See the complete training process in action:
- Implementation of the perceptron learning algorithm
- Training datasets for logical gates (AND, OR, XOR)
- Detailed training loop with weight updates and error calculations
- Real-time feedback showing how the perceptron learns from mistakes

**Getting Started:**
1. Use the page dropdown menu at the top to navigate between pages
2. Start with **Inference** to understand how predictions work
3. Then explore **Training** to see how the perceptron learns
